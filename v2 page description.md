# html page mockup for ranked wars status board v2

the purpose of this prototype is to show a prototype of v2 of a web app for raned war coordination for my faction in the online game Torn

The page has a header area and then a three column layout. the central column is what users wil be working with the most. 

each column contains cards for the players that are in the grouping, with various amounts and types of information for the players in each column. 

# column 1 (left): enemy players

each card has the following info:
 * xanax taken (number and pill icon, an indicator of player strength)
 * donator days (number of days, or years, months, days, etc), another indicator of strength
 * online indicator (green traffic lightt)
 * PLAYER NAME, link to player profile
 * last action taken column (relative to now, e.g. ,4 minutes ago, just now, etc) - shows when they were lastt active relative to now


# column 2 (center)): enemy players in the hospital

this could maybe better be a datatable than a card set. each row would have:
 * xanax taken (number and pill icon, an indicator of player strength)
 * donator days (number of days, or years, months, days, etc), another indicator of strength
 * online indicator (green traffic lightt)
 * PLAYER NAME, link to player profile
 * last action taken column (relative to now, e.g. ,4 minutes ago, just now, etc) - shows when they were lastt active relative to now
 * time remaining in the hospital (ultimately, folks will sort on this)
 * friendly player claiming the target, if any
 * a button that says "Claim" if the target is unclaimed, otherwise says "Release"

 # column 3 (right): friendly players online

each card has the following info:
 * xanax taken (number and pill icon, an indicator of player strength)
 * donator days (number of days, or years, months, days, etc), another indicator of strength
 * online indicator (green traffic lightt)
 * PLAYER NAME, link to player profile
 * last action taken column (relative to now, e.g. ,4 minutes ago, just now, etc) - shows when they were lastt active relative to now
